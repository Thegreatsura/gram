# Repository structure

- [mise.toml](mdc:mise.toml) is where all the versions of tools used by this project are specified. It also contains all the relevent environment variables for local development.
- `/package.json` is the workspace-level package.json file and it should only contain dependencies affecting related to maintaining the overall project.
- `/tsconfig.json` is the base TypeScript config file. It should always have the strictest compiler flags enabled. All other tsconfig.json files created should extend this file.
- [go.work](mdc:go.work) is the Go workspace file. Any time a new top-level Go project is created in this repository it should be listed in this file.
- `.mise-tasks/` contains all the runnable scripts for working in this repository. If a script is located at `.mise-tasks/go/tidy.sh` then it can be run with `mise go:tidy`. Similarly if a Python file is located at `.mise-tasks/api.py` then it can be run using `mise api`.
- `/server` is where the Gram API service is being developed. It is built with Go.
