# Gram

Gram is the tool platform for AI agents.

## Development

Run `./zero` until it succeeds.

## Coding guidelines

All coding guidelines are written out as Cursor rules in [.cursor/rules](.cursor/rules). Please make sure you read these before contributing to this project.

Everything under the `# Coding assistant guidelines` headers is intended for AI agents. Everything else is intended for all audiences.

## Putting up pull requests

You must have a good title and description for your PR. Please do not be lazy about this or write it off as trivial. Go nuts with streams of commits but invest the 5 minutes to present a reviewable PR with good context. This is a non-starter.
