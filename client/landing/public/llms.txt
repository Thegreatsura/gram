# Gram - AI Tool Platform

Gram is a platform for creating, hosting, and distributing AI tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables developers to transform APIs into AI-native tools that work seamlessly with AI agents and LLMs.

## What is Gram?

Gram solves the challenge of connecting APIs and data sources to AI systems. Instead of building custom integrations for each AI client, developers can create MCP servers once and make them available across all compatible AI platforms.

## Key Features

### MCP Server Hosting at Scale
- Deploy MCP servers with one click
- Zero downtime deployments for new versions
- Continuous testing and refinement of tool performance
- Enterprise-grade reliability and performance

### Tool Curation and Management
- Group tools into focused toolsets for specific use cases
- Remix tools across APIs and third-party services
- Scope access by team and user permissions
- Instant quality testing and validation

### API-to-Tool Transformation
- Auto-generate tool definitions from OpenAPI specifications
- Create higher-order tools for complex workflows
- Catalog and organize tools for easy distribution
- Support for any REST API or data source

### Enterprise Distribution
- Model and framework agnostic gateway
- Managed authentication and authorization
- Built-in telemetry, audit logs, and rate limiting
- Secure tool distribution across organizations

### Plug & Play Integration
- Interactive playground interface for testing
- Seamless OAuth integration
- Ready-to-use landing pages
- Zero integration required with popular AI clients

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your API**: Bring your OpenAPI spec to create a tool for each operation
2. **Configure & Test**: Set up authentication, test tools, and configure access
3. **Distribute**: Share your toolset with teams or make it publicly available

## Target Users

- **API Developers**: Transform existing APIs into AI-native tools
- **AI/ML Engineers**: Build robust tool ecosystems for AI applications
